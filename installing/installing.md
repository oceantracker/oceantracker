We recommend using Python environments to install OceanTracker.
This ensures that the versions of the necessary packages are handled correctly and makes the entire process more reliable for users and developers.
The recommended way to create these environments is by using Mamba, a fast version of Anaconda.

You can find the documentation on how to install mamba here:
https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html


Install using pip 
_________________

If this is your first time using OceanTracker, the easiest way to install it is via pip.

::

    # Create a new mamba/conda environment
    # conda create -n oceantracker
    mamba create -n oceantracker
    # conda activate oceantracker
    mamba activate oceantracker

    # Install oceantracker via pip
    pip install oceantracker

Note: 
- You may need to run Conda as Admin on  Windows
- Using this method you won't have easy access to the tutorials directly. However, you can simply download them manually from github: https://github.com/oceantracker/oceantracker/tree/ed3186156d5cfe9b7b2c7c15452c7c25be5ceae9/tutorials_how_to

Please reach out, either via mail or by writing a github issue, if you are running into bugs. We'd be happy to fix them.


Install by building from source
_______________________________

This is recommended if you plan on working with OceanTracker more extensively or if you are already familiar with python development environments.

::

    # Navigate to a directory of your choice
    cd /path/to/your/directory

    # Clone or download the repository
    git clone https://github.com/oceantracker/oceantracker.git
    cd oceantracker

    # Create and activate the environment
    mamba env create -f environment.yml
    mamba activate oceantracker

    # Or if you plan to contribute the development of oceantracker
    mamba env create -f environment-dev.yml
    mamba activate oceantracker-dev

You can also create your own environment as before by::

    cd /path/to/your/directory

    # Clone or download the repository
    git clone https://github.com/oceantracker/oceantracker.git
    cd oceantracker

    mamba create -n name_of_your_environment python=3.12
    mamba activate -n name_of_your_environment

    pip install -e .
    # or
    # pip install -e .[dev]


Initial test runs
_________________

To check that everything runs as intended at this stage you can test your installation by launching your python shell::

    python

Check that you are using the correct python environment::

    import sys
    print(sys.executable)

and then try to spin up OceanTracker::

    import oceantracker
    print(f"OceanTracker version: {oceantracker.__version__}")
