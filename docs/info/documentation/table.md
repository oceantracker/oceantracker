| **Key Citation** | Blanke and Raynaud (1997); Blanke et al. (1999) | Döös et al. (2017) | Wang et al. (2016) | d'Ovidio et al. (2015) | Paris et al. (2013b) | Lange and van Sebille (2017) |
| **OGCMs Supported** | NEMO/OPA, ROMS, Symphonie and any C-grid | NEMO, IFS (AGCM), MOM, MICOM, POM, HYCOM | MITgcm; any C-grid | AVISO satellite velocities; any velocity field on A-grids (euclidean or spherical) | HYCOM, OFES, NEMO, SOSE, MOM, MITgcm | NEMO, OFES, GlobCurrent; customizable to any OGCM with NetCDF data format |
| **Language(s)** | Fortran 90/95; Matlab (IDL on request) for visualisation | Fortran | Fortran | GNU/Octave and C++ | Fortran | Python user interface, auto-generated C |
| **Primary Use** | Offline calculation of 3D streamlines in the velocity field at any scale (regional, basin, global); volume transport calculations | 3D water mass pathways, particle/tracer dispersion | 3D watermass pathway, particle/tracer dispersion, cross-frontal transport, Argo float simulation | Compute satellite based Lagrangian diagnostics to optimize sampling strategy of mesoscale-based field campaign and support interpretation of in-situ observations | Dispersion, connectivity, fate of pollutants; Individual Based Modelling | Large scale oceanography; Individual Based Modelling; teaching (via customizable interface) |
| **Advection Method** | Analytic | Analytic | RK4 | RK4 | RK4 | RK4, RK45, Explicit Euler; extensible interface for custom advection methods |
| **Diffusion Method** | No diffusion (purely kinematic method) | Brownian motion for background diffusion with random displacement or randomly added velocities | Brownian motion for background diffusion, random displacement within the mixed layer | Random walk optional | Brownian motion for background diffusion, random displacement within the mixed layer | Extensible interface for Random Walk and custom behaviour |
| **Grids Supported** | Arakawa C, also tested with Arakawa B interpolated on C-grid, partial cells supported | Arakawa A, B, C. Spatially and temporally varying vertical grids supported (partial cells, z*, sigma, hybrid) including those for AGCMs | Arakawa C | Arakawa A | Orthogonal (rectangular) Arakawa A, B and C | Arakawa A, B and C; unstructured meshes planned |
| **Key Strengths** | Almost 25 years of experience with core of the code; easy-to-install, easy-to-use; fast analytical solution; no coast crash; qualitative mode (full details of selected trajectories) and quantitative mode (volume transport calculations); compatible with the conservation laws of the OGCM | Volume conserving, fast analytical solutions without intermediate time steps, works with both OGCMs and AGCMs | Fast using Fortran, supports openMP | Designed to work out-of-the-box with AVISO surface geostrophic velocities. Already configured to compute a broad range of Lagrangian diagnostics (i.e. Finite Time/Size Lyapunov Exponents; longitudinal and latitudinal origin of particles; time of particle retention within mesoscale eddies etc.) | Modular, fast, parallel; Multigrid support; Used in a wide variety of contexts, from marine ecology to physical oceanography | Ease-of-use, customizable extension interface and automated performance optimization |
| **Shortcomings** | No parallel mode; trajectory scheme is somewhat crude beyond the context of 3D water mass tracing | Need of improving the diffusion method | Non-scalable parallelization, not very efficient in reading large model output | Particle advection only 2D; cannot be run in parallel | No support for non-orthogonal grids; parallel implementation is heavy on I/O | Not yet parallel; support for unstructured meshes in progress |
