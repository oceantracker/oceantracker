Future additions
===================

* support for structured grids, eg. ROMS
* option for particle tracking to work natively in lat/log cords
* RK45 solver to allow adaptive time stepping to improve accuracy for those particles where flows are rapidly varying in time or space.

Possible additions
===================

* merge numerical solver and random walk by moving to numerical solution as a stochastic ODE?



Minor additions
====================

#. support short class_name's given by user ie just AgeDecay,not  oceantracker.particle_properties.age_decay.AgeDecay
#. show dry cells on plots
#. ensure all classes are updated by and .update() method
